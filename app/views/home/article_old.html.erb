	<p>Hope springs occasional in the movie business. As that business scrambles to anticipate (digitally or otherwise) what we watch, the way we watch it and where, one season ends and another begins.

Even the enjoyable superhero films this sum- mer couldn't prevent a person from thinking: Enough. By the time "The Avengers" arrives next spring, it'll feel like a remake.</p>

	<p>We can expect "The Help" to turn up on Oscar night (Feb. 26) because Hollywood loves a winner, and a classy middlebrow success is the traditional definition of a winner. I hope a few of the pictures about to make their conspicuous debuts at the larger film festivals, notably Toronto, Venice and New York, turn out wonderfully so that we can talk about something other than "The Help" for a while.</p>
	<p>Call me counterintuitive in this season of Oscar hopefuls and awards talk, but I yearn for good, grown-up genre filmmakingâ€”escapism with some style.

"I preferred the West- erns, the crime films, the farces, the frankly commercial," he wrote.</p>
	<p>It's not a matter of diminished ex- pectations to acknowledge the com- mercial film industry's Hippocratic Oath: First, do no boredom. It's simply acknowledging the pleasure the right diversion can deliver. If you get a little artistry out of it, terrific.</p>
	<p>Wouldn't it be nice if director Ste- ven Soderbergh's panic-stricken pan- demic thriller "Contagion" (opening Sept. 9) jangles our nerves and gets us thinking? And if director Bennett Miller's "Moneyball" (Brad Pitt as Beane) manages to transcend the well-meaning, "respectable" biopic genre loathed by Greene, I say: Atta film!</p>
	<p>The big Oscar guns aren't likely to arrive until November and December. For now, through October, here are 10 to anticipate. Assuming the movies' historical adherence to baseball per- centages, if these 10 bat .250, we'll be all right.</p>
